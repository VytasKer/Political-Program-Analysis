### **Quantitative Analysis of Lithuanian Party Program Text Files**

**Project Overview**

This repository contains the code and results of a quantitative analysis conducted on the text files of various Lithuanian political party programs. The goal of this analysis was to gain insights into the word usage, sentence length, and other textual characteristics of these programs.

**Key Findings**

* **Word Count:**
  * **Most Words:** Laisvės Partija used the most words in their program.
  * **Fewest Words:** Nemuno Ausra used the fewest words in their program.

* **Frequent Words:**
  * Several parties used the same words most frequently, including "Lietuvos", "Valstybės", "Sveikatos", "darbo", and "sieksime".

* **Sentence Length:**
  * **Longest Sentences:** LSDP, Vardan Lietuvos, and Lietuvos Valstiečių ir Žaliųjų Sąjunga (potential coalition partners) wrote the longest average sentences.
  * **Shortest Sentences:** Liberalų Sąjūdis and Laisvės Partija (parties with similar political views) wrote the shortest average sentences.

**Data and Methodology**

* **Data:** The analysis was based on text files extracted from the party programs.
* **Methodology:** The following techniques were employed:
  * **Word Counting:** Counting the frequency of words in each program.
  * **Sentence Length:** Calculating the average sentence length in terms of words.
  * **Text Analysis Tools:** Utilizing natural language processing libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy) for tasks such as tokenization and part-of-speech tagging.

**Repository Structure**

* **data:** Contains the text files of the party programs.
* **code:** Houses the Python scripts used for data analysis.
* **results:** Stores the output of the analysis, such as visualizations and statistical summaries.

**Future Work**

* **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzing the sentiment expressed in the party programs.
* **Topic Modeling:** Identifying the main topics discussed in each program.
* **Comparative Analysis:** Comparing the programs based on specific themes or keywords.
